              This is a weather dashboard that was built as a project for the
              UCSD web development bootcamp program. This application allows a
              user to search for any city in the world and it will return real
              time weather conditions in that city, as well as a 5-day weather
              forecast. The application relys on the Open Weather API to access
              the weather data.

              This is a password generator that I built for a project in the
              UCSD web development bootcamp program. The goal of the password
              generator is to give a user the option to choose which characters
              they would like to include in their password, such as numbers,
              uppercase letters or special characters, as well as the length of
              the password. The user can then copy the newly generated password
              to their clipboard. The application runs on JavaScript and uses
              Bootstrap to provide styling and responsiveness.

              Dungeon Bud is a web application that allows Dungeons & Dragons
              players to save characters and campaigns to a database. The goal
              of the application is to help players save their campaign and
              character information to a database. Users have unique profiles
              where they can add, edit or delete the campaigns and characters
              that they have added to the database. They can also add their
              characters to other playerâ€™s campaigns or add other player's
              characters to the campaigns they have created.
